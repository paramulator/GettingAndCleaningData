# GettingAndCleaningData
Repo for the Getting and Cleaning Data class project 

exact recipe from source to target

The instruction list
Ideally a computer script (in R :-), but I suppose Python is ok too...)
The input for the script is the raw data
The output is the processed, tidy data
There are no parameters to the script
In some cases it will not be possible to script every step. In that case you should provide instructions like:

Step 1 - take the raw file, run version 3.1.2 of summarize software with parameters a=1, b=2, c=3
Step 2 - run the software separately for each sample
Step 3 - take column three of outputfile.out for each sample and that is the corresponding row in the output data set

You should also include information about which system (Mac/Windows/Linux) you used the software on and whether you tried it more than once to confirm it gave the same results. Ideally, you will run this by a fellow student/labmate to confirm that they can obtain the same output file you did.
